  # Title: Ocean Conservation

  # Description:
  I began this project to address the problem of people polluting our oceans by constantly dumping plastics and other harmful chemicals in the oceans. Marine life in the ocean can be devastated by the harmful affects of platics choking them or restricting their movement. It is time that the human race treat our oceans with better care and recycle properly.

  I want others to use this project to educate themselves on the topic of keeping our oceans clean and have their recycling habits change for the better.
